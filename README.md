# Understanding-Instagram-Influencer-Trends-Using-MySQl
In today’s digital age, social media platforms like Instagram play a major role in shaping consumer choices and brand reach. Influencers have become powerful marketing channels for businesses to connect with target audiences in authentic ways.
This project analyzes a
dataset of top Instagram influencers to explore trends in follower counts, engagement rates,
popular categories, and geographic reach. By organizing and querying this data using MySQL,
we aim to discover meaningful patterns that can help brands, marketers, and analysts make
informed decisions for effective influencer marketing strategies.
• Brands and agencies often struggle to identify which influencers will deliver maximum reach
and engagement for their campaigns.
• There is a lack of structured, data-driven selection.
• The goal is to analyze influencer data to rank influencers by followers, engagement, and
category.
